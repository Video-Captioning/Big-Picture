# Experiment #3
## Detecting Rapid Motion

1. Setup: 'great_catch.flv'

2. Run Lucas_Kanade_optical_flow.py
```bash
./Lucas_Kanade_optical_flow.py
```

3. Notice that in the first 15 frames, a player runs rapidly to the left. The grey images show high-intensity blobs in the runner's location. Once the runner slows, the intensitiy diminishes as well.


### Results -- SUCCESS!
